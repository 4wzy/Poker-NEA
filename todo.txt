Allow players to export the hall of fame as a text file (to get the writing and reading from files mark)

Somehow implement inheritance, possibly polymorphism?

Implement hash tables and use hashing to store passwords.
Find a way to use stacks if you can.

FIGURED OUT BUG POSSIBLY??
The bug with multiple winners being displayed may have to do with when 2 players both still have money after 1 of them
has gone all in.

For example if players 1, 2, and 3 have 50 chips and player 4 has 200 chips.
If player 4 raises 50 chips and all players go all in and player 3 wins..
Player 3 and 4 will be displayed as winners instead of just player 3

SIDE NOTE:
SIDE POTS SEEM TO ACTUALLY BE WORKING PROPERLY!
TEST THIS OUT WITH 2 PLAYERS AT THE END OF A POKER GAME and show on video :)
